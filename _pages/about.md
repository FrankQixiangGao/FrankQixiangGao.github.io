[Noah Smith](https://nasmith.github.io) is a computer scientist working at the junction of natural language processing (NLP), machine learning (ML), and computational social science. His research spans core problems in NLP, general-purpose ML methods for NLP, research methodology in NLP, and a wide range of applications.

# Appointments & Education

He is a Professor in the [Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering](http://www.cs.washington.edu/) at the [University of Washington](http://www.washington.edu/) (also Adjunct in [Linguistics](https://linguistics.washington.edu/), Affiliate of the [Center for Statistics and the Social Sciences](https://www.csss.washington.edu/), and Senior Data Science Fellow at the [eScience Institute](http://escience.washington.edu/)), as well as a Senior Research Manager at the [Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence](https://allenai.org/). Previously, he was an Associate Professor of Language Technologies and Machine Learning in the [School of Computer Science](http://www.cs.cmu.edu) at [Carnegie Mellon University](http://www.cmu.edu).  He earned his Ph.D. in Computer Science from [Johns Hopkins University](http://www.jhu.edu) and his B.S. in Computer Science and B.A. in Linguistics from the [University of Maryland](http://www.umd.edu).

# Service

Smith has served on the editorial boards of the journals [*Computational Linguistics*](http://www.mitpressjournals.org/loi/coli) (2009&ndash;2011), *[Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research](http://www.jair.org)* (2011&ndash;present), and [*Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics*](http://www.transacl.org) (2012&ndash;present), as the secretary-treasurer of [SIGDAT](http://www.sigdat.org) (2012&ndash;2015 and 2018&ndash;present), and as program co-chair of [ACL 2016](http://acl2016.org/).  He co-organized the [Ninth Annual Conference on New Directions in Analyzing Text as Data (TADA 2018)](https://nlp.washington.edu/tada2018).
