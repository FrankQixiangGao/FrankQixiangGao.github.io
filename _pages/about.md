Engineering](http://www.cs.washington.edu/) at the [University of
Washington](http://www.washington.edu/), as well as a Senior Research
Manager at the [Allen Institute for Artificial
Intelligence](https://allenai.org/). Previously, he was an Associate
Professor of Language Technologies and Machine Learning in the [School
of Computer Science](http://www.cs.cmu.edu) at [Carnegie Mellon
University](http://www.cmu.edu). He received his Ph.D. in Computer
Science from [Johns Hopkins University](http://www.jhu.edu) in 2006 and
his B.S. in Computer Science and B.A. in Linguistics from the
[University of Maryland](http://www.umd.edu) in 2001. His research
interests include statistical natural language processing, machine
learning, and applications of natural language processing, especially to
the social sciences. His book, *Linguistic Structure
Prediction*, covers many of these
topics. He has served on the editorial boards of the journals
[*Computational Linguistics*](http://www.mitpressjournals.org/loi/coli)
(2009–2011), *[Journal of Artificial Intelligence
Research](http://www.jair.org)* (2011–present), and [*Transactions of
the Association for Computational Linguistics*](http://www.transacl.org)

[Sounding Board](https://sounding-board.github.io/) team won the
inaugural Amazon Alexa Prize. He was named an ACL Fellow in 2020, "for
significant contributions to linguistic structure prediction,
computational social sciences, and improving NLP research methodology."
Smith's work has been recognized with a UW Innovation award (2016–2018),
a Finmeccanica career development chair at CMU (2011–2014), an NSF
CAREER award (2011–2016), a [Hertz
