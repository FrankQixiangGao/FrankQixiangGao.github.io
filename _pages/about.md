[Noah Smith](https://nasmith.github.io) is a computer scientist working at the junction of natural language processing (NLP), machine learning (ML), and computational social science. His research spans core problems in NLP, general-purpose ML methods for NLP, research methodology in NLP, and a wide range of applications.

He is a Professor in the [Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering](http://www.cs.washington.edu/) at the [University of Washington](http://www.washington.edu/) (also Adjunct in [Linguistics](https://linguistics.washington.edu/), Affiliate of the [Center for Statistics and the Social Sciences](https://www.csss.washington.edu/), and Senior Data Science Fellow at the [eScience Institute](http://escience.washington.edu/)), as well as a Senior Research Manager at the [Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence](https://allenai.org/). Previously, he was an Associate Professor of Language Technologies and Machine Learning in the [School of Computer Science](http://www.cs.cmu.edu) at [Carnegie Mellon University](http://www.cmu.edu).  He earned his Ph.D. in Computer Science from [Johns Hopkins University](http://www.jhu.edu) and his B.S. in Computer Science and B.A. in Linguistics from the [University of Maryland](http://www.umd.edu).

He has served on the editorial boards of the journals [*Computational Linguistics*](http://www.mitpressjournals.org/loi/coli) (2009&ndash;2011), *[Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research](http://www.jair.org)* (2011&ndash;present), and [*Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics*](http://www.transacl.org) (2012&ndash;present), as the secretary-treasurer of [SIGDAT](http://www.sigdat.org) (2012–2015 and 2018–present), and as program co-chair of [ACL 2016](http://acl2016.org/). Alumni of his research group, [Noah's ARK](http://www.ark.cs.washington.edu), are international leaders in NLP in academia and industry; in 2017 UW's [Sounding Board](https://sounding-board.github.io/) team won the inaugural Amazon Alexa Prize. He was named an ACL Fellow in 2020, "for significant contributions to linguistic structure prediction, computational social sciences, and improving NLP research methodology."  Smith's work has been recognized with a UW Innovation award (2016&ndash;2018), a Finmeccanica career development chair at CMU (2011&ndash;2014), an NSF CAREER award (2011&ndash;2016), a [Hertz Foundation](http://www.hertzfoundation.org) graduate fellowship (2001–2006), numerous best paper nominations and awards, and coverage by NPR, BBC, CBC, *New York Times*, *Washington Post*, and *Time*.
