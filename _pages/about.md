[Noah Smith](https://nasmith.github.io) is a computer scientist working at the junction of natural language processing (NLP), machine learning (ML), and computational social science. His research spans core problems in NLP, general-purpose ML methods for NLP, methodology in NLP, and a wide range of applications.
You can watch videos of some of his [talks](talks), read his [papers](publications), and learn about his research groups [Noah's ARK](ark) and [AllenNLP](https://allennlp.org/).

### Appointments & Education

He is a Professor in the [Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering](http://www.cs.washington.edu/) at the [University of Washington](http://www.washington.edu/) (also Adjunct in [Linguistics](https://linguistics.washington.edu/), Affiliate of the [Center for Statistics and the Social Sciences](https://www.csss.washington.edu/), and Senior Data Science Fellow at the [eScience Institute](http://escience.washington.edu/)), as well as a Senior Research Manager at the [Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence](https://allenai.org/). Previously, he was an Associate Professor of Language Technologies and Machine Learning in the [School of Computer Science](http://www.cs.cmu.edu) at [Carnegie Mellon University](http://www.cmu.edu).  He earned his Ph.D. in Computer Science from [Johns Hopkins University](http://www.jhu.edu) and his B.S. in Computer Science and B.A. in Linguistics from the [University of Maryland](http://www.umd.edu).

### Service

Smith has served on the editorial boards of the journals [*Computational Linguistics*](http://www.mitpressjournals.org/loi/coli) (2009&ndash;2011), *[Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research](http://www.jair.org)* (2011&ndash;present), and [*Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics*](http://www.transacl.org) (2012&ndash;present), as the secretary-treasurer of [SIGDAT](http://www.sigdat.org) (2012&ndash;2015 and 2018&ndash;2019), and as program co-chair of [ACL 2016](http://acl2016.org/).  He co-organized the [Ninth Annual Conference on New Directions in Analyzing Text as Data (TADA 2018)](https://nlp.washington.edu/tada2018),
[Language Technologies and Computational Social Science](http://www.mpi-sws.org/~cristian/LACSS_2014.html) (a workshop at ACL 2014), and [Twenty Years of Bitext](https://sites.google.com/site/20yearsofbitext/) (a workshop at EMNLP 2013).

### Recognition

Smith was elected a Fellow of the Association for Computational Linguistics "for significant contributions to linguistic structure prediction, computational social sciences, and improving NLP research methodology" (2020).  UW's [Sounding Board](https://sounding-board.github.io/) team, led by Profs. [Mari Ostendorf](https://people.ece.uw.edu/ostendorf/), [Yejin Choi](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~yejin/), and Noah Smith won the inaugural Amazon Alexa Prize in 2017.
Smith's research was recognized with a UW Innovation award "to stimulate innovation among faculty from a
  range of disciplines and to reward some of their most terrific
  ideas" (2016&ndash;2018), the Finmeccanica career development chair at CMU "to  acknowledge promising teaching and research potential in junior faculty members" (2011&ndash;2014), an NSF CAREER award (2011&ndash;2016),
a [Hertz Foundation](http://www.hertzfoundation.org) graduate fellowship (2001&ndash;2006).
He has coauthored conference papers that were cited as outstanding, finalist, honorable mention, and sometimes even "best paper" or "best student paper" at [ICLP 2008](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~nasmith/papers/cohen+simmons+smith.iclp08.pdf), [ACL 2009](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~nasmith/papers/martins+smith+xing.acl09.pdf), [COLING 2010](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~nasmith/papers/nguyen+vogel+smith.coling10.pdf), [NAACL 2013](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~nasmith/papers/chahuneau+smith+dyer.naacl13.pdf), [ACL 2014](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~nasmith/papers/flanigan+thomson+dyer+carbonell+smith.acl14.pdf), [NAACL 2015](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~nasmith/papers/faruqui+dodge+jauhar+dyer+hovy+smith.naacl15.pdf), [WWW 2016](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~nasmith/papers/wilson+etal.www16.pdf), [EACL 2017](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.05774.pdf), [NAACL 2018](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~nasmith/papers/clark+ji+smith.naacl18.pdf), [ACL 2018](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~nasmith/papers/peng+thomson+smith.acl18.pdf), [ACL 2019](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.00591.pdf) ([twice](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~nasmith/papers/sap+card+gabriel+choi+smith.acl19.pdf)), and [ACL 2020](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.10964.pdf).
