 I spend a lot of time reading and writing email. I wish I had more time for advising my students, learning new things, thinking about my research, and writing papers. Every message I take the time to read chips away at that time; please respect this fact when writing to me.

(If you're not sure how to email, or you're finding that emailing professors is not getting you the results you want, consider reading [this article on how to email](http://matt.might.net/articles/how-to-email/) or [these tips](http://www.pgbovine.net/email-tips.htm).)

Here is a quick, imperfect guide to emailing me.

### Please email me if:

* you have specific technical questions about my research (it's always good to CC my coauthors in case they can answer a question faster or better than I can)
* you're interested in a postdoc and might want to be on my list of people I will notify if I have an opening (please note: at this time, I don't have any open positions, but updates will be posted here)
* you are attending a conference I might be attending (most years I go to ACL, EMNLP, NAACL if it's being held, and one or two others in machine learning, computational social science, or some other related topic) and want to set up a time to chat

I will do my best to reply promptly. Students have called me an Email Ninja, but I make no promises.

### If you would like to apply to work in Noah's ARK:

If you are an undergraduate or masters student in Seattle and would like to work on research with my group, please complete this [demonstration of research interest](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~nasmith/temp/challenge.pdf).  Please follow the instructions carefully.  In general, I encourage you to apply if you are a student at UW or any other school in or near Seattle, and you think you have a role to play in my ARK.

### If you would like to apply to work at the Allen Institute for AI:

AI2, and specifically my team (AllenNLP), has applications online for a variety of positions, including research internships, engineering internships, predoctoral and postdoctoral researchers, engineers, and scientists. [Find out more here](https://allenai.org/careers#current-openings). 

### Please do *not* email me if:

* you're interested in taking NLP and need an add code; instead, please use the links on the course website to petition.
* you're considering applying for grad school at UW (Ph.D. or masters programs) but don't have any specific technical questions
: (This is great, and I encourage you to apply! Go for it, and feel free to discuss your research vision and how it would fit into my group in your statement. I can't give any feedback on your application before or after you apply, but I do look for a small number of new Ph.D. advisees each year. Please trust me that emailing me just to tell me that you're applying will make absolutely no difference.)
* you're considering applying for grad school at CMU
: (This is great! Because I no longer work there, I can't really help you.)
* you're a student outside the US looking to be an intern or a student looking to visit my group
: (I'm very sorry, but I cannot host you at this time, and I get a huge number of requests of this kind. If you have a professor who thinks I should find a way to make it work, please ask him/her to contact me on your behalf.)
* you don't know me personally but would like to invite yourself as a visiting scholar at UW
